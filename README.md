# Charitability

## Inspiration
For people who thoroughly love thrifting, we thought why not be able to do something we enjoy while also giving back. Creating this app provides with the socially acceptable platform to donate to charities and thrift.

## What it does
As a "seller", you can post items that you do not need anymore and choose a specific charity and donation amount for the "buyer" to donate and recieve the item. The money that would've been gone towards purchasing the item would now go towards a charity.

## How we built it
We used Figma, HTML, & CSS to create our prototype of our app that we hope in the future to actually implement. We also incorporated wireframing and sketching to successfully create it.

## Challenges we ran into
An issue was creating the flow between the frames and a lack of experitise but with our hardwork and determination we were able to finish our project!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The Home page and the cart pages are some of our favorite parts of our prototype and we are proud of the way they turned out.

## What we learned
We learned how important the designing process in software development and are more appreciative towards UI/UX and their methodologies.

## What's next for Charitability
Charitability will most defiinitely become an actual application as we believe that something like this should definitely exist.
